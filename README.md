# INFO90003-DNI
This project is a work-like prototype for a draw remote control system based on arm movement detection.

The displayed work does not contain all designed function due to cost limit, time limit and technical limit.

The software of this project is coded by Arduino.

The operation is very simple, the only thing users need to do is to rotate their arm and put their arms up and down
